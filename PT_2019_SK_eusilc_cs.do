*** NOTE: No statutory right to paternity leave. The individual entitlement 
		  for fathers is a hybrid between individual transferable right (mother) 
		  and individual entitlement (father). Father can use the entitlement 
		  when the mother of the child agrees with him providing full-time care 
		  for the child, when the mother dies, cannot provide care, or abandons
		  the child. Father can use the right after mother's entitlement to maternity
		  leave expires.
